# Dynamic Programming

I am starting with Dynamic Programming. I will try to solve some DP questions on daily basis.<br>
As of now I am totally alien to DP, hence I will start from the basics and build up on that to move towards Advance DP Problems.<br>
Anyone who wants to learn and practice Dynamic Programming is welcome to solve the Problems that I post in this repository.<br>
You can create a directory of your own name in this repository and add the Problems that you have solved in the directory<br>
You should make a **README** of the Problems that you had a hard time in solving, that way you can revise them later.
That's it lets try to master DP starting from the bottom.
